css_inline
==========

|Build| |Version| |Python versions| |License|

Fast CSS inlining for Python implemented in Rust.

Features:

- Removing ``style`` tags after inlining;
- Resolving external stylesheets (including local files);
- ... more features will be available soon

**NOTE**. This library is in active development and provides a small number of features at the moment, see ``Limitations`` sections below for more information.

Installation
------------

To install ``css_inline`` via ``pip`` run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    pip install css_inline

Usage
-----

To inline CSS in a HTML document:

.. code:: python

    import css_inline

    HTML = """<html>
    <head>
        <title>Test</title>
        <style>
            h1, h2 { color:blue; }
            strong { text-decoration:none }
            p { font-size:2px }
            p.footer { font-size: 1px}
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Big Text</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Solid</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="footer">Foot notes</p>
    </body>
    </html>"""

    inlined = css_inline.inline(HTML)

If you want to inline many HTML documents then you can utilize ``inline_many`` that processes the input in parallel.

.. code:: python

    import css_inline

    css_inline.inline_many(["...", "..."])

For customization options use ``CSSInliner`` class:

.. code:: python

    import css_inline

    inliner = css_inline.CSSInliner(remove_style_tags=True)
    inliner.inline("...")

Performance
-----------

Due to the usage of efficient tooling from Mozilla's Servo project (``html5ever``, ``rust-cssparser`` and others) this
library has good performance characteristics. In comparison with other Python projects, it is ~12-15x faster than the nearest competitor.

For inlining CSS in the html document from the ``Usage`` section above we have the following breakdown in our benchmarks:

- ``css_inline 0.1.0`` - 24.82 us
- ``premailer 3.7.0`` - 356.59 us (**x14.37**)
- ``inlinestyler 0.2.4`` - 2.62 ms (**x105.82**)
- ``pynliner 0.8.0`` - 3.03 ms (**x122.44**)

You can take a look at the benchmarks' code at ``benches/bench.py`` file.
The results above were measured with ``rustc 1.46``, ``Python 3.8`` on i8700K, and 32GB RAM.

Limitations
-----------

Currently (as of ``0.1.0``) there are the following notable limitations:

- Inlined CSS is not minimized (`#12 <https://github.com/Stranger6667/css-inline/issues/12>`_)
- `class` and `id` attributes are not removed (`#13 <https://github.com/Stranger6667/css-inline/issues/13>`_)

Python support
--------------

``css_inline`` supports Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.
